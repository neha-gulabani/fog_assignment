# High level approach to this assignment
To build a music player UI in React, start by designing the layout with key components such as album art, song details (title and artist), playback controls (play, pause, next, previous), a progress bar, and time display. Break the UI into reusable components like Player, AlbumArt, SongDetails, PlaybackControls, and ProgressBar. Use React's useState for managing playback status, current time, and duration, and useRef to control the <audio> element for handling playback. Sync the UI with the audio element by listening to events like timeupdate and using properties like duration. Style the UI to mimic Spotify's sleek design, incorporating a dark theme (#121212), minimalistic typography, vibrant green accents, and smooth hover effects for interactivity. The player should feel responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing.
